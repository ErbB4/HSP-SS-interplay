# HSP_SS_interplay
This repo contains experimental data, simulation data, sample code for running network simulation, and code for data analysis that have been generated during the development of the project: Interplay between homeostatic synaptic scaling and homeostatic structural plasticity maintains the robust firing rate of neural networks.

This project is now available as a preprint paper: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.09.531681v1
