This folder contains the experimental data and analysis scripts for Fig2.

The experimental datasets were obtained using entorhinal-hippocampal organotypic tissue cultures prepared from P3-P5 mice brain.

Ephs data was recorded sEPSC traces from WT cultures under acutre treatment of three NBQX concentrations (0, 200 nM, and 50 μM).

Spine density data was obtsianed from apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in Thy1-eGFP cultures before and after three day NBQX treatment with three concentrations (0, 200 nM, and 50 μM).
