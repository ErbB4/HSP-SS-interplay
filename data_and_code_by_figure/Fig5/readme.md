This folder contains simulation results and simulation/plotting code used in Fig5, where we systematically screened the responses of HSP rules (linear and two Gaussian variants) under various activity perturbations.


For the activity perturbation parameter scan plot, the raw data was too big to be shared here. So the analyzed mean and std of synapse number per neuon were included in the main folder.
