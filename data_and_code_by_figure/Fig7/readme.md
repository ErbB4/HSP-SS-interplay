This folder contains the code and simulated results for Fig7, where synaptic scaling was applied in parallel to homeostatic structural plasticity upon silencing. We onserved that synaptic scaling upscaled the input excitatory synaptic weights and such change in recurrent connectivity may reactive silent neurons and shift silencing-induced disconnection to rewiring.

In this example study, three intensities of synaptic scaling strengths were applied for comparison reasons: without synaptic scaling (no_SS), weak synaptic scaling (weak_SS), and synaptic scaling with an increased (doubled) scaling strength (doubled_SS).
